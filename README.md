# BadUSB-Anti-AFK
DuckyScript 3.0 instructions for BadUSB automatically generating HID keyboard input to avoid AFK penalties or other inactivity based shutdowns.

I put this together to avoid AFK disconnects in Sea of Thieves and learn some DuckyScript, but the keypresses and durations can be easily modified to suit other purposes.
